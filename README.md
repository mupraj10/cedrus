# A Simple Boilerplate

NERDS STACK

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start:dev`. If you using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
4. If you navigate to the URL you should see some UI already :) 
5. Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`
